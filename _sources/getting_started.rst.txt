The **TOPTICA Python Laser SDK** supports Python 3.6 and later. It depends on `pyserial <https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/>`_ for serial and `ifaddr <https://pypi.org/project/ifaddr/>`_ for network connections. Both packages are installed automatically when using ``pip``.


Installation

Install or upgrade to the latest version of the package::

    $ pip install --upgrade toptica_lasersdk

.. warning::
   This document describes Version 3 of the SDK which introduced some backward incompatible changes compared to previous versions.
